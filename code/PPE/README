To run PPE, copy the file 'Ppe' to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/
You have to be placed in the PPE directory when you start
ppe (using the command 'ppe'), because the program will look
for drum sounds etc. in the subdirectories.

You should replace the files in the SAMPS directory with
samples you might want to use (they must be called samp0-samp13.aiff).

There is a kind of automation function, but it is a little silly
and flaky.

I'm not seriously involved in this program, so don't have your
hopes too high about improvements.
