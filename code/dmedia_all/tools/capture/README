Patch 1765 is absolutely necessary for the tools in this directory to work
properly.

avcapture
=========
avcapture will synchronously record uncompressed video and audio in realtime 
to a disk array.  Data is stored in the QuickTime file format using
SGI digital media libraries.


Movie Files
==========

All of the tools in this directory use libmoviefile to create file formats.
Files created with these tools can be used by other the SGI Digital Media Tools,
including moviemaker(1), mediaplayer(1), and mediarecorder.
Some of the file formats discussed are only available with newer versions of 
the SGI Digital Media Libraries.

Movie file formats are data structures that store
time based material, usually in the form of tracks.  An
example of a track is the image track which is composed of
a sequence of individual images. Sometimes the image track
is also called the video track. A typical movie file
contains two tracks of time based material, an audio track
and an image track.

Uncompressed 

The uncompressed method is exactly what it says. The data
for each frame is left unmodified. This results in large
file sizes and high bandwidth required to play and record
these files to and from disk.

SGI Movie 

This is a proprietary format defined by Silicon Graphics.
There are three versions of this format available.
Beginning with IRIX 5.1, all of the digital media tools and
libraries output version three movie files. As of IRIX 5.3,
the tools and libraries can still read version one and two
files, but cannot write them.  The tools will not create SGI movie files.

QuickTime 

QuickTime is an extension of the Apple Macintosh operating
system software to allow manipulation of time-based data
such as audio, video, and animations. QuickTime movies
can be captured and played.

With avcapture and avplayback SGI Digital Media Libraries 
support the following QuickTime movie file formats:

o	"Raw" (uncompressed) 

o	"Raw" (uncompressed) with SGI extensions to 
	support RGBA, ABGR, RGBA1555 and YUV422 
	pixel packing formats. 

The SGI Digital Media Libraries do not support the
QuickTime editing API.

V-LAN
=====

Copy the following V-LAN commands into a text file without any leading
whitespace and run avcapture or avplayback with the [-v cmd_file_name] option.
There is also a simple V-LAN command file (vlan.setup) which provides a
commented example of V-LAN commands.
For avcapture the last command issued should be RV (review).
For avplayback the last command issued should be PF (perform).

It is IMPORTANT not to use the PF command when reading data from a video tape
deck and capturing to a disk array (avcapture) as the record mode of the deck
will be enabled and the tape will be erased if it is not write protected.

V-LAN provides frame accurate deck control for a wide variety of professional
quality decks via the serial port.  Note that an RS-232 to RS-422 protocol
converter may be required on O2.  The V-LAN firmware can be upgraded (in most
models) by obtaining the download program and firmware images from the
Videomedia web site: http://www.videomedia.com.
