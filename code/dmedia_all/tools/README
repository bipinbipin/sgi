This directory contains production utilities for SGI digital media products.
The intention this directory is to provide tools which work across the product
line independent of digital media devices, i.e. if it lives here it must work
on all of SGI's new (O2, Octane, Onyx2/Origin/DIVO) products.  We will not be
providing backwards support for older products such as Indigo, Indy, Impact, 
and Sirius video products.  When the images are installed the source will be 
placed in this directory, /usr/share/src/dmedia/tools, and binaries will be 
installed in /usr/sbin.  A make in the local directories will leave binaries 
local.

The tools directory contains the following subdirectories:

vlan - source to V-LAN library

capture - real-time capture tools
