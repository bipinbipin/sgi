The sceneDetector program read a stream of video from the default
video input jack, and creates a movie file.  It attemps to detect
scene transitions (based on total difference between successive
frames), and only puts one frame per scene in the output movie.

To run the program, use "make" to compile it, and then type
"sceneDetector".  It will create a movie called "scenes.mv" in the
current directory.  As each scene is detected, a frame from the
previous scene is displayed on the screen.
