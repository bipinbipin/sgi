This directory contains the example program vidtonet, that captures 
frames from a video source into dmbuffers and sends them over the 
network using dmnet, and nettovid, that receives dmbuffers from dmnet
and sends them to video out. Note that these are simple examples to
illustrate the use of dmnet with vl, so no buffering is done to avoid
jitter, lost frames, etc.

nettovid (the server) must be invoked before vidtonet.

Under Irix 6.3 (uname -a), DMEDIA_6_3 must be defined (this is commented
out in the Makefile).

Typical usage :
<server> nettovid &
<client> vidtonet -T <my_machine>

disktonet and nettotex are similar to vidtonet and nettovid. disktonet
opens a movie file, captures frames into DMbuffers and streams them to
nettotex, which displays the frames on graphics. disktonet is multithreaded,
and accesses movie library and direct I/O routines. You should run disktonet 
as root to get real time performance. nettotex uses OpenGL and XWindows for
display. These pair of programs were mainly intended to be used for streaming
film resolution content (the default frame for nettotex is 1280x720x3). To
get 24 frames/sec, you should use a disk array and a fibre based network, with
an available bandwidth of at least 70 MB/sec. 

dmttcp is derived from the original ttcp, and helps you determine the
maximum achievable throughput with dmNet.
