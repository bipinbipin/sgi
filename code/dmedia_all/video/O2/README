These are some examples of using DMbuffers to pass images between
video and OpenGL on O2:

lib:

	This is a small C++ library that holds classes to perform
	common operations, such as starting a video path and 
	creating a window.  This makes it easy to write example
	programs.

	The error handling in the library is simple, it just prints
	a message and exits when something goes wrong.  Real
	application programs would have to check error codes and 
	do something more polite.

	The library uses reference counting for memory management (see
	lib/RefCount.h).

clock:

	This shows how to composite grahpics onto video by using
	the incoming video frames with a digital media pbuffer.
	The composited images are sent to video output.

	It also shows how to use stenciling to render the two
	fields of a video frame separately.

copypixels:

	This is an alternative method of compositing, where video 
	images are copied onto the screen, rendered onto, and then
	copied to video output buffers.  It is less efficient
	that the method used by "clock".

fieldblend:

	This is a third way to do compositing.  The graphics are
	rendered onto the screen, and then copied onto the video
	frame, with blending enabled.

image:

	An static image (from an image file) is overlayed on video,
	with interactive controls to size, scale, rotate, and fade the
	image. 
	
videoin:

	Puts video input into a window.
