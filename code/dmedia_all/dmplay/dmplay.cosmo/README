        has been implemented.

dmplay -p graphics,engine=impact 	file.mv

dmplay -p graphics,engine=impact -p audio 	file.mv

	Play back an SGI movie using Impactcomp JPEG decompression, display
        in a graphics window. Realtime playback, with synchronized audio playback.

dmplay -z n/d ...

	Zoom up or down playback window by n/d. 
        It can be expressed as either a fraction or a float.


Playback engine for these modes is "streamDecompressEv1.c"
