compdecomp: compress and decompress realtime example
----------------------------------------------------

JPEG compresses video from the default video input port (as 
specified on vcp) into main memory, then decompresses that
data out of main memory to the default video output port.

Presents a slider bar on the graphics monitor that allows 
the user to select the compression ratio, in the range 
2:1 (best) to 75:1 (poor).

The video output display is how the source data would look
compressed and decompressed at the specified compression
ratio.
