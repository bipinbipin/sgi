This directory contains very simple programs which illustrate
how to use various aspects of the OpenGL pixel processing functionality

convolve.c	- convolution demo program.  allows the user to convolve
		  an input image with full control over all of the convolution
		  parameters.

colormatrix.c	- colormatrix demo program. 'a' rotates RGBA to ABGR, 'b'
		  converts to black and white (luminance), 'n' turns off
		  the colormatrix, 'r' nulls out the G,B, and A channels,
		  's' increases the saturation and 'S' decreases the
		  saturation.

laplace.c	- simple demo which convolves the input image with the
		  3x3 laplace operator  0 -1  0 .  the 'l' key toggles whether
				       -1  4 -1
				        0 -1  0
		  the filter is enabled or not.
