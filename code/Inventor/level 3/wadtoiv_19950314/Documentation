What is wadtoiv?
----------------

As the name implies, wadtoiv is a Doom WADfile to Inventor converter.
It reads in the main Doom or Doom 2 wad (plus, optionally, a patchwad)
and outputs a specified level's polygons and associated textures.


How do I use wadtoiv?
---------------------

First, put wadtoiv in your path. Then make a directory for its output
(which, be forewarned, will be lots of .rgb files, plus the .iv file),
and cd there. Create a symlink to doom.wad or doom2.wad in the output
directory (or copy it there, if you have the disk space and really
want to).

The command line options are as follows:

wadtoiv [-f <filename>] [-2] -e <episode> -m <mission>

"filename" is the pathname of an optional patch wad.

The -2 option turns on Doom 2 mode. wadtoiv will look for "doom2.wad"
as the main wad in this mode. Additionally, it will expect the
patchwad, if any, to be a Doom 2 patchwad.

For Doom 1 mode (default), episode and mission must be between 1-3 and
1-9, respectively. For Doom 2 mode, the episode is ignored, and the
mission must be between 1 and 32.

Note that specifying no command line options will cause the program to
print its usage. Both episode and mission default to 1.


What doesn't wadtoiv do?
------------------------

Right now it doesn't handle raised ceilings and sunken floors. They
could be handled properly by expressing the ceiling and floor polygons
as trimmed NURBS instead. This is left as an exercise for the reader. :-)


How do I use the output from wadtoiv?
-------------------------------------

SceneViewer E*M*.iv  [MAP**.iv if Doom 2 mode]
or:
ivview -q E*M*.iv

(filling in the episode and mission of the level you've outputted)

All of the .rgb files must be in the same directory as the .iv file in
order for textures to work.


Legalese
--------

DOOM is a trademark of id software, inc.

Thanks to Raphael Quinet and Brendan Wyber for distributing the source
for DEU, their Doom Editor Utility, from which several functions (and
all the wad data structures) came.

This program comes with absolutely no warranty.
